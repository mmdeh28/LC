Control Systems Project - Linear Control and Frequency Domain Analysis
This project and research involve files and analyses related to linear control and system analysis in the frequency domain. Various topics such as root locus analysis in time-delay systems, the Routh-Hurwitz method, and the study of system representations in the frequency domain are discussed. The project also includes MATLAB simulations, Bode plots, step response analyses, various controller designs, and assignments for practice.
Topics Discussed:
Root Locus in Time-Delay Systems
This section focuses on the root locus analysis in systems with time delay. Delay in control systems can significantly affect system stability and dynamic response. The Root Locus method is used to observe how the positions of the poles change with varying system parameters and delays. This section includes explanations of the Root Locus methodâ€™s principles and the challenges encountered in time-delay systems.
Routh-Hurwitz Method and Derivation when a Row Becomes Zero
In the Routh-Hurwitz method, when a complete row of the matrix becomes zero, derivation is required to continue the calculations. This step is necessary to avoid division by zero and ensure the stability and accuracy of the calculations. This section provides a detailed explanation of why this derivation is necessary and how it enhances the accuracy of the Routh-Hurwitz equations.
Study of System Characteristics in the Frequency Domain
This section examines how systems are analyzed in the frequency domain. Representing systems in the frequency domain offers several advantages over time-domain analysis, such as the ability to analyze system behavior in response to various inputs (e.g., step inputs, sinusoidal signals). This section discusses key tools in the frequency domain, such as Bode plots, and the fundamental differences between Fourier and Laplace representations. The characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of each method are explained intuitively.
